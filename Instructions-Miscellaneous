Tun it on your machine (Termux/Linux)

A) Get the tool

git clone https://github.com/technocratslave-art/pmos-port-assist.git
cd pmos-port-assist
chmod +x pmos_port_assist.py

B) Put logs in a folder

Make a folder like:

mkdir -p logs

Copy your logs into logs/:

logs/old.log

logs/new.log


Step 3 — Run the “safe compare” (this is the main command)

This is the command you will use 90% of the time:

python3 pmos_port_assist.py logs/new.log --compare logs/old.log --safe

What this creates:

logs/new.log.analysis.md  (single-log report)

logs/new.log.signals.json

logs/new.diff.md          (the progress/regression report)

logs/new.comparison.json

✅ Open logs/new.diff.md first. That’s the money file.

Step 4 — What to look at (fast)

Open the diff report:

cat logs/new.diff.md

In that file, you care about 4 sections:

1. Boot Progress
says if boot got further (timestamp delta)


2. Signal Count Changes

shows if probe_fail went down, init_fail went up, etc.


3. Regressions

if it says new panic_oops or init_fail, that’s a “you broke something” alarm


4. New / Resolved


the actual semantic error lines that changed

Step 5 — “I don’t even have logs saved, only serial spam”

No problem. Pipe it.

Example (you capture UART into a file, then run):

cat uart_capture.txt > logs/new.log
python3 pmos_port_assist.py logs/new.log --safe

If you literally want to run from stdin:

cat uart_capture.txt | python3 pmos_port_assist.py - --safe

Step 6 — What you send to the porters

You send ONLY these two files:

new.diff.md (progress + regressions)

new.log.analysis.md (single-log context)


If they want machine-readable:

new.comparison.json

3 Common “gotchas” you’ll hit

1) “No timestamps found”

That means your log doesn’t include [  12.345] style lines.
Still useful — diff works on semantic errors.

2) “Too many noisy probe failed”

That’s normal on Qualcomm. The tool is built to show trend.
If probe_fail drops across boots, you’re winning.

3) “I don’t want ANY tail output”

Use:

python3 pmos_port_assist.py logs/new.log --compare logs/old.log --safe --no-tail

(--safe already includes --no-tail in the version I gave you.)
